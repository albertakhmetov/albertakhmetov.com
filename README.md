Hello everyone! My name is Albert and I'm a software developer.

During my life I managed to work with .NET via C# (desktop and web), TypeScript (Angular), JavaScript (vanilla), databases (via Dapper, Entity Framework and even via simple ADO.NET; worked with Firebird, MySQL, Microsoft SQL Server, Oracle and Redis) - see my [LinkedIn profile](https://en.linkedin.com/in/albertakhmetov) for details. 

However, my hobby is writing applications for Windows.

For desktop applications, I used almost every available .NET UI framework: Windows Forms, WPF, Silverlight and WinUI3. I'm currently interested in Windows App SDK and I plan to talk about Windows modern programming at [albertakhmetov.com](https://albertakhmetov.com/).
